# Human-Agent Collaborative Game
Framework used during my PhD in Human-Computer Interaction. The goal is to destroy missiles before they reach cities.

The player can interact with different agents (AIs) designed to help with the aiming process.

The difficulty of the task, accuracy, reliability and behaviour of the agents can all be modified by editing the JSON Files in /text_resources folder.

All sessions generate logs of players' performance and behaviours in Godot local LOGS folder.

Surveys can also be presented to players in-between or during gameplay.

Note: between the first and last study conducted using this framework, a lot of things were tweaked/changed. The current state of the framework does not match exactly the one used in any of the study presented in the list of publications below.

## Getting Started

To run the project, simply import it using Godot Engine 3.2 (not sure of the compatibility of this project with Godot Engine version > 3.2).
Then run the scene file from the "2D" panel.

### Prerequisites

* Windows, MacOS or Linux.
* Godot Engine 3.2 (seek previous releases): https://godotengine.org/download .

## The output
